## Introduction for One by Metallica

Today I will be taking a deeper look at the introduction of one of Metallica’s most famous songs “One.” “One” is a very dark and sad song about a man who suffered awful injuries from war and is kept alive in a hospital but wishes to die instead of being left alive. The goal of the introduction is to set the scene for this man as he begins to sing about his pain. If you want more information about the lyrics, they are linked <a href="https://genius.com/Metallica-one-lyrics">here</a> but this post will focus on the music the song opens with.

To begin, the song is written in B minor. Minor key makes perfect sense for this song since its subject is so dark. The piece begins with a back and forth between the i chord and nondominant seventh chord VI<sup>7</sup> except the VI<sup>7</sup> chords are missing tonic. The leap from g to f along with the missing tonic creates a feeling of emptiness present in measures 2, 4 and 6. This dichotomy of the VI<sup>7</sup> and i broken chord creates a pleasing yet unsettling base introduction to the song. Measure 6 breaks this back and forth between the i and VI<sup>7</sup> chord with a III chord which foreshadows a coming change in the music. The low of measure 6 is between g and b which are the lows of the previous measures. The use of a as the low in measure 6 lets the low note take consecutive steps downwards while keeping all other notes the same leading to the abrupt change in the base in measure 8. The change is marked by a switch to 2/4 time signature and then immediately back to 4/4 and a break in the repetition of the low high low med pattern. We have a fast low high low high which creates a strange and short change of pace as the piece goes back to 4/4 and the baseline takes a step back as the melody comes in.

The baseline for measures 9-16 is the exact same as the baseline for measures 1-8. Nothing new there. However, the melody comes in and uses a lot of stepwise motion with some leaps of a 3rd. There’s only one leap that’s greater than a 3rd which is a 4th in measure 12 as the piece dips downwards. This is super interesting because the baseline loves taking leaps while the melody is filled with passing tones like the commonly used dcb/bcd in measures 10,11,13 and 14. These nonharmonic tones which are also present as neighboring tones such as in measure 12 (ded) create a smooth yet unique melody that's calm but at the same time picks up the pace of the piece. This is then slowed down in measures 13-15 where we then have another abrupt measure 16 in 2/4 that's the same as measure 8 which again signifies a significant change in the music to come. Measure 12 really stands out to me as it brings feelings of nostalgia from my days of playing Guitar Hero III. It sticks out due how fast paced it plays relative to the long notes surrounding it - preceded by a half note and followed by a dotted half note. This is one of my favorite parts of "One" and is one of the parts that always comes to mind when I think of this introduction.

Next, we look at the last section of what I’d consider the first half of the introduction before we have a change in the melody. The composers of Metallica (James Hetfiled and Lars Ulrich) have this interesting suspension-like drop moving from measure 20 to 21. Then they use a combination of steps and leaps of a 3rd to reach a high point then to only drop back down to b. These musical "lead-ons" keep me wanting more and for the introduction to hit a peak here which it does in measure 22. The upward steps and leaps break through on the third attempt and the music keeps climbing until it hits e6. We end on bb which makes sense as the key is b minor and hit a melody break that is similar to measures 8 and 16 but doesn't revert to a 2/4 time signature but it signals the end of the first half of the introduction. We had baseline break melody break melody longer break in this first half. I consider measures 1-24 to be a part of the first half of the introduction and 25-39 as the second half.

Jumping octaves is usually a difficult task to do well, but I feel Metallica did a decent job here. They used the abruptness from the reoccuring break measure and began the second half on b exactly two octaves lower where they ended the first half (on b). These two together I feel works very well here and now we're introduced to a new melody. Whats cool about this melody is that it has the same melodic construction of low high low medium from the begining of piece and follows the same chord progression of i-VI<sup>7</sup>i-VI<sup>7</sup>. I wasn't expecting this when analyzing the score of "One" but it's interesting how the beginning of what I consider the two halves have the same chord progression even though they sound different and are at a different pace having changed to 3/4 time. They've very similar in that respect.

Lastly, we'll look at measures 34-39 which end off the introduction and lead to the first verse of the song. The first hting that sticks outt to me is the use of stacked notes in the melody - the only place where this occurs in the melody. I imagine someone playing a xylophone and going down the keys when i hear this section of the song. Its unique and what I feel plays into this is the stacked notes moving up and down stepwise. This creates a lot of stepwise motion mostly downwards and the low note of one stacked note becomes a high note almost immediately after. For example in measure 35, we have in the melody db-ec-db-ca. The stepwise motion is e-d-c and simultaneously c-b-a.
